Hack The BOX 
Types of Shells
Type of Shell	Method of Communication
Reverse Shell	Connects back to our system and gives us control through a reverse connection.
Bind Shell	Waits for us to connect to it and gives us control once we do.

Web Shell	Communicates through a web server, accepts our commands through HTTP parameters, executes them, and prints back the output.
Web Server	Default Webroot
Apache	/var/www/html/
Nginx	/usr/local/nginx/html/
IIS	c:\inetpub\wwwroot\
XAMPP	C:\xampp\htdocs\

https://github.com/GhostPack/Seatbelt Seatbelt is a C# 
project that performs a number of security oriented host-survey "safety checks" relevant from both offensive and defensive security perspectives.

There are specific directories that we may be able to utilize to add new cron jobs if we have the write permissions over them. These include:

/etc/crontab
/etc/cron.d
/var/spool/cron/crontabs/root
If we can write to a directory called by a cron job, we can write a bash script with a reverse shell command, which should send us a reverse shell when executed.

Exposed Credentials
Next, we can look for files we can read and see if they contain any exposed credentials. This is very common with configuration files, log files, and user history files (bash_history in Linux and PSReadLine in Windows).

SSH Keys
Finally, let us discuss SSH keys. If we have read access over the .ssh directory for a specific user, we may read their private ssh keys found in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa or /root/.ssh/id_rsa, and use it to log in to the server. If we can read the /root/.ssh/ directory and can read the id_rsa file, we can copy it to our machine and use the -i flag to log in with it:
sumitvirdi@htb[/htb]$ vim id_rsa
sumitvirdi@htb[/htb]$ chmod 600 id_rsa
sumitvirdi@htb[/htb]$ ssh user@10.10.10.10 -i id_rsa
