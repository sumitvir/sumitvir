While connecting to the service, we noticed that the connection took longer than usual (about 15 seconds). There are some services whose connection speed, or response time, can be configured.
Now that we know that an FTP server is running on this port, 
we can deduce the origin of our "failed" scan. We could confirm this again by specifying the minimum probe round trip time (--min-rtt-timeout) in Nmap to 15 or 20 seconds and rerunning the scan.
